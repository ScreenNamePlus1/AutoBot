To effectively implement this tool in its final stage which is not here yet, you must have a network router that is capable of SQL packet injection, these usually are loaded with custom software, and an antenna attachment for that router.
Or the equivalent. 

These are not complete working files for the final outcome of this project. this is the basis for a project. That's why I posted the code and read me. Those files in that read me only work with themselves and they are not functional for the proper operation of this project. If I posted that it would be illegal. This is a private project from here on out.

You have the tools that you need at your disposal. The mission is clear should you accept it.
